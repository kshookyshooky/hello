    <h1>Kyle Shook</h1>
    <p>My design experience is short however I made some strong progress when I majored in this program. My focus is on advertising design where I primarly make posters and other printed material. What my real interest actually lies, is that I love to illustrate. I prefer photoshop whenever I make one instead Illustator as I can freehand stuff easily and create some intresting stuff. Photography also intrests me where I mostly take photos of models and close-ups of objects</p>
    <p>The real past experience I have with art was by drawing and making ceramics. Once I learned how to use Illustraor better I tend to practice and learn a few things of my own through making personal art. I gained more knowledge of illustration in depth by using color pencils and used what I experienced with them by translating that for digital art. The most clients I had gotten was by making digital paintings in Photoshop that I'll use to make portraits. I currently study and refine overtime my skills to draw more attention of clients as I can make some intresting visuals. My personal goal right now is to learn fine art in general as that resonates with me on a extreme level and a lot of fun to try out in my freetime.</p>
