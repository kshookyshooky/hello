    <h1>Kyle Shook</h1>
    <p>My design experience is short however I made some strong progress when I majored in this program. My focus is on advertising design where I primarly make posters and other printed material. What my real interest actually lies, is that I love to illustrate. I prefer photoshop whenever I make one instead Illustator as I can freehand stuff easily and create some intresting stuff. Photography also intrests me where I mostly take photos of models and close-ups of objects</p>
    <p>The real expication by being in JCTC is for me to gain knowlege of graphic design in gerneral. I also wanted to establish a complete portfolio for me to use anywhere whenever I want to find a job or apply at a 4-year school. The other expectation I have is to show progress on how creative I can be and become better at it over time. My time in JCTC will end soon as I'm close to meeting those expectations I have and I tend on finishing them the best way I can.</p>
    <p>Changes!</p>
